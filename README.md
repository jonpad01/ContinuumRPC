## What Is It?
Continuum RPC (cRPC) is a plugin used alongside the normal Continuum game executable that provides a Discord rich presence status when using the Continuum client.

## How Do I Use It?
* Download the latest official release from [here](https://github.com/purge-dev/ContinuumRPC/releases).
* Unzip the contents into your main Continuum folder, overwriting your Continuum.exe (you can make a backup if you wish).
* Run the game as usual. Any existing shortcuts/launch options you made will still work, and all game platforms on **Windows** are supported.
